## Instructions to run
1. Navigate to folder */kevs chess*
2. *NPM install*
3. *NODE src/server.js*
4. *NPM run dev*
5. Navigate to localhost:8080

## On-going Issues I'm still working on
* Piece can move over another piece (Should only allow Knight)
* Player can take on piece in the same side (Friendly fire not yet fixed)
* Pawn should attack diagonal
